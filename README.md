# Loretta VSCode

## Features

A really barebones language server for lua/glua with the following features:
- Semantic Syntax Highlighting
- Autocomplete
- Go To Definition
- Code Formatting

## Known Issues

- Currently autocomplete does not offer known library methods (like `string.gsub` and etc.).
- Currently there is no support for autocomplete or go to definition for tables.
- Currently there is no support for code formatting customization.
- Code formatting is a bit weird currently.
